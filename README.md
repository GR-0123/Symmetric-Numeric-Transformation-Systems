Abstract
This research introduces two innovative numeric transformation systems with unique properties:

Tri-Set Numeric Interaction System: A framework organizing numbers into three sets with distinct combination rules
Number Mirror Symmetry: A system rooted in modular arithmetic that reveals mirror relationships preserving digital roots
Both systems reveal intricate relationships between numeric sets and demonstrate unexpected computational behaviors and structural symmetries.
